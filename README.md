# From Tools to Adoption: A Path to Modular and Interactive Scientific Publishing

Overview and information for the "From Tools to Adoption: A Path to Modular and Interactive Scientific Publishing" meeting

## Description

We are convening a 2.5 day, in-person implementation sprint in November 2025 to unify modular scientific publishing tools around a shared reference implementation. This working meeting will convene developers of leading modular publishing tools such as MyST, Quarto, Curvenote, and Kotahi to create a working, federated reference architecture using real bioRxiv content and deploying through the newly created openRxiv labs. The goal is to resolve technical gaps, demonstrate live interoperability, and lay the foundation for modular, machine-readable research publishing. The sprint is preceded by a virtual kickoff and includes discussions and activities at CZI's Open Science Meeting and JupyterCon. This meeting is designed to unlock adoption by showing, not telling, how modular publishing can work in practice today.

Our approach for the workshop is to convene a small group of around 20 leaders and tool makers in open science to align on a collective vision/demonstrations and implementations to drive meaningful change. Given the small size and implementation focus, this meeting is by invitation only. Summaries and outcomes will be shared publicly. 

This meeting is funded by the Meeting Fund of The Navigation Fund Open Science Program. [DOI 10.71707](https://commons.datacite.org/doi.org/10.71707/gn91-ka32), dates and location updated in this description.

## Abstract
Scientific content remains trapped in static formats that limit reuse, attribution, and machine readability, despite the availability of modern tooling that makes this possible and better matches how scientists conduct research. This initiative, led by openRxiv and Continuous Science Foundation, addresses this challenge through practical implementation rather than consensus-driven standardization. The project will convene developers of leading modular publishing tools—MyST, Quarto, Curvenote, and Kotahi—to create a working, federated reference architecture using real bioRxiv content and deploying through the newly created openRxiv labs. Through a facilitated virtual meeting followed by a 2.5-day in-person implementation sprint, participants will develop shared interoperability standards and demonstrate live reuse of scientific content. Following the successful ipynb model, the approach prioritizes working software over abstract frameworks. Key deliverables include a reference implementation demonstrating cross-platform interoperability, pilot deployments using bioRxiv articles, progress updates at the CZI Open Science Meeting, and adoption materials for publishers and platforms. This implementation-first approach represents a concrete step toward modular publishing that meets current needs while preparing for the LLM era.
